# wellcome_bioinformatics

Repo for the course [Bioinformatics for Biologists](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/bioinformatics-for-biologists-an-introduction-to-linux-bash-scripting-and-r-20230717/)

Along the course I'll try to use conda to manage package installation. Its  not part of the course, but I think it might be helpfull to practice.


## TODO
[] Install conda
[] Create dependency file
[] Continue with week 1
