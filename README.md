# wellcome - Bioinformatics for Biologists

Repo for the course [Bioinformatics for Biologists](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/bioinformatics-for-biologists-an-introduction-to-linux-bash-scripting-and-r-20230717/)

Along the course I'll try to use conda to manage package installation. Its  not part of the course, but I think it might be helpfull to practice.

## Week1

* Introduction to using bash  
* Basic file handling
* Good to remember:
  * awk - package to work with delimited files (csv, tsv, etc)
  * grep - working with patterns / regex  
  * chmod - adjust file permisstions

## Week2

* Started writing mini bash scripts 
* Played a bit with relativ and absolute file paths
  * Not sure what is best practice here


## TODO

* Continue Week 2, Step 2.9
